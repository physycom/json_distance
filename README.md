[![Build Status Master](https://travis-ci.org/physycom/json_distance.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/physycom/json_distance "master")


### Installation
**Make** and a **C++11** compatible compiler are required. Clone the repo and type ``make all``.  
There's also a **VS2015** solution avalaible.

Uses [jsoncons library](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons).
