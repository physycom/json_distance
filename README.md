### Purpose
This tool has been written in order to benchmark GNSS solution performances with respect to a reference system. It takes two .json files as input, one for the reference device and one for the benchmarked device, it interpolates the reference at the exact timestamp of each benchmarked device measurement and it gives the distance between the two points.


### Installation
**make** and a **C++11** compatible compiler are required. Clone the repo and type ``make all``.  
There's also a **VS2015** solution avalaible.   
Uses [jsoncons](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons) as a git submodule.


### Usage
```
json_distance.exe -i input1.json input2.json -o output.json
```
where *input1.json* and *input2.json* must be existing and valid .json files, while *output.json* is the name of the output .json with the distance between selected points in the input data.
